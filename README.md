You may think I'm a front-end engineer, but I'm a back-end engineer.
The above information is somewhat inaccurate, the above statistics are more HTML, but the programming languages I mainly use are Python and C++.

I am very interested in information technology, I am currently researching AI and cybersecurity.

If you want to cooperate with me on a project, or recommend some software or source code to me, please email me at suvgli@dingtalk.com.

I would like to chat with you, and you can add me as a friend at some of my accounts:

WeChat Number: bclwxh321

Dingtalk Number: suvgli

You can also watch some of my videos on [BiliBili - BCL](https://space.bilibili.com/1543403511). Like you, I often post some videos about programming/information technology

Thank you for reading this passage!
