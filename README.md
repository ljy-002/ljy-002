I often write programs in Python, and I also use C++ and HTML.

I am very interested in information technology, I am currently researching AI and cybersecurity.

I like to do interesting projects like rockets.

If you want to cooperate with me on a project, or recommend some software or source code to me, please email me at suvgli@dingtalk.com.

You can also watch some of my videos on [BiliBili - BCL](https://space.bilibili.com/1543403511). Like you, I often post some videos about programming/information technology

Thank you for reading this passage!
